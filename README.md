# Flutter-Projects
Where I store my early projects on path to learning Flutter/Dart. Here are some of the projects I currently completed.

### I am Rich
This application is a preview of some gold, and a remake of the classic iOS app called I am rich, which stood as an app with just a photo of a diamond for $999.99.

### I am Poor
This is just a remake of the I am rich app, to reinforce some rules about flutter and dart.
